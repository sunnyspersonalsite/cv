          <h3>Arguing &amp; Coding</h3>
          <p>I can argue for hours until I get what I want. This also helps with my programming becasue I am very persistent. I am also very convincing, so I could also be a salesman. I am learning a lot of code that may be usefull in my future. I might be a coder or lawyer when I grow up, but both jobs are really fun.</p>

          <h3>I am really good at basketball.</h3>
          <p>When it is summer time I go to my park or the rec center and I shoot hoops. I can practice for more than 4 hours a day. I played with a team and we won the playoffs and the championship.</p>
